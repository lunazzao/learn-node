- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.
- Will the order of execution change if the delay in the while loop is changed from 10s to 150s? Why or why not?
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?

someAsyncOperation
100ms have passed since I was scheduled

1. 150ms
The order of execution will not change because the event loop processes the timer callback only after completing the current executing callback (from someAsyncOperation). 
However, the timer callback will be delayed (bacuase 50 ms more time is added).

2. 0
The order in which the console logs Changed.
With the setTimeout logging its message before someAsyncOperation,
 depending on the precise timing of the event loop's processing of timer callbacks relative to I/O callbacks.
